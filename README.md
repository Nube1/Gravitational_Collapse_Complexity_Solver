## Description

This Python project numerically evaluates the analytical solution for the **scale factor** \(f(t)\) derived from the pressure isotropy condition in gravitational collapse models. It generates the time-evolution profiles for:

- Metric scale factor \(f(t)\)
- Thermodynamic heat flux \(q(t)\)
- Luminosity \(L(t)\)
- Structural **Complexity Factor** \(Y_{TF}\)

The solver captures the dynamics from **static equilibrium**, through **symmetry breaking**, up to the **singularity**.

## Features

- High-resolution simulation of gravitational collapse dynamics
- Analytical solution for the scale factor integrated into the script
- Three-panel visualization of metric evolution, thermodynamic quantities, and complexity growth
- Safe handling of singularities and post-collapse states

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
